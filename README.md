# Digital Signal Processing

I have started re-learning digital signal processing by re-doing the works in my past projects. Especially, I am very interested in Digital **Audio** Processing and **Acoustinc Scene Classification** with a low-end and low-power-consumption MCU such as STM32L476RG from STMicroelectronics.

## Digital Audio Processing

Learn DSP basics!

=> [Digital Audio Processing](DigitalAudioProcessing)

## Speech Processing for AI

Learn Audio feature engineering basics for Acoustinc Scene Classification!

=> [Speech Processing for AI](SpeechProcessing)

## AI Rock Paper Scissors

Run Rock Paper Scissors machine with edge AI!

=> [Rock Paper Scissors](RockPaperScissors.md)

## Acoustic Scene Classification (Work in progress)

Develop practical use cases with acoustic scene classifcation!

=> [Acoustic Scene Classification](AcousticSceneClassification.md)

## Wish list

I am interested in the following areas:
- Mic array
- Ultrasonic communications
