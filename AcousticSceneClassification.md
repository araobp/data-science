# Acoustic Scene Classification

This is a project to develop edge AI for Acoustic Scene Classification based on STM32Cube.AI, referring to my past project: https://github.com/araobp/acoustic-features

### Step 1: Evaluation of MEMS microphone and DFSDM

=> [MEMSMIC](STM32/MEMSMIC.md)

### Step 2: Acoustic Feature Camera (without AI)

=> [ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA](STM32/ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA.md) (Work in progress)

### Step 3: Analog Filter

=> [ANALOG FILTER](STM32/ANALOG_FILTER.md) (Work in progress)

### Step 4: Acoustic Feature Camera with DAC

### Step 5: Data Collection

- Musical Instruments
- Key Words
- Life Log

### Step 6: Training CNN on Jupyter Notebook

### Step 7: Acoustic Feature Camera (with AI)
