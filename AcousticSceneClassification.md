# Acoustic Scene Classification

This is a project to develop edge AI for Acoustic Scene Classification based on STM32Cube.AI, referring to my past project: https://github.com/araobp/acoustic-features

### System Architecture

```
   [Android app] ---- BLE ---- [NUCLEO L476RG]
```

### Step 1: Evaluation of MEMS microphone and DFSDM

=> [MEMSMIC](STM32/MEMSMIC.md)

### Step 2: Acoustic Feature Camera (without AI)

=> [ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA](STM32/ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA.md) (Work in progress)

### Step 3: Android app

Develop an Oscilloscope app on Android, referring to https://github.com/araobp/android-aed

### Step 4: Training CNN on Jupyter Notebook

### Step 5: Acoustic Feature Camera (with AI)
