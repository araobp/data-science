# Full Stack Data Scientist

(Work in progress)

I used to be a full stack data scientist in the past.

This project is to relearn the every technology to become a full stack data scientist again. A lot of fun!

- IoT circuit design : Physics, Electronics and CAD
- IoT device prototyping : Circuit board and C/C++ programming
- Feature engineering : Fourier Transform and digital signal processing
- AI and neural network : DNN, CNN, Tensorflow and Keras
- AI application development : Python and Android(Kotlin)
- AI deployment : IoT devices and web apps (Node.js/HTML5/CSS/JavaScript)
- Data Analysis : Jupyter Notebook, numpy, pandas and matplotlib
- AI visualization : Blender

## [Step 1] Training myself

### [Digital Audio Processing](DigitalAudioProcessing)

The best text book that I have ever read in my life: [C言語ではじめる音のプログラミング―サウンドエフェクトの信号処理](https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274206504/)

This folder contains Python-version of the C programmes in the book.

Note: although my most favorite language is C, I use Python for studying data science in this project.

### [Speech Procesing](SpeechProcessing)

In September 2018, I found this great paper on the net: https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html

I relearn it in this project.

### [STM32](STM32)

This is a sub project to develop an edge AI device for the "Speech Processing" in the above, referring to my past project: https://github.com/araobp/acoustic-features

## [Step 2] Prototyping Acoustic Scene Detection

## Others

### [Arduino](Arduino)

Arduino is a device for testing sensor modules. Let Jupyter Notebook to collect data from sensors.

This is me.

### [CIFAR 10](CIFAR10)

The best accuracy I have ever achieved is 75%. Can I get a higher score than 75%?
