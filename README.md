### [Digital Audio Processing](DigitalAudioProcessing)

The best text book that I have ever read in my life: [C言語ではじめる音のプログラミング―サウンドエフェクトの信号処理](https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274206504/)

This folder contains Python-version of the C programmes in the book.

Note: although my most favorite language is C, I use Python for studying data science in this project.

### [Speech Procesing](SpeechProcessing)

In September 2018, I found this great paper on the net: https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html

I relearn it in this project.

### [Arduino](Arduino)

Arduino is a device for testing sensor modules. Let Jupyter Notebook to collect data from sensors.
