(Work in progress)

I used to be a full stack data scientist in the past.

This project is to relearn the every technology to become a full stack data scientist again. A lot of fun!

## [Step 1] Training myself

### [Digital Audio Processing](DigitalAudioProcessing)

The best text book that I have ever read in my life: [C言語ではじめる音のプログラミング―サウンドエフェクトの信号処理](https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274206504/)

This folder contains Python-version of the C programmes in the book.

Note: although my most favorite language is C, I use Python for studying data science in this project.

### [Speech Procesing](SpeechProcessing)

In September 2018, I found this great paper on the net: https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html

I relearn it in this project.

### [STM32](STM32)

This folder contains my DIY works on STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L476RG board with the latest version of CubeIDE/CubeMX and Python3.

### [Rock Paper Scissors](RockPaperScissors)

I developed Rock Paper Scissors on Nucleo L401RE board with Panasonic AMG8833 in 2018, just after the first relase of Cube.AI became available for developers: [The demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d6OYSllaVEs)

I relearn it in this project by doing this: https://github.com/araobp/stm32-mcu/tree/master/NUCLEO-F401RE/Thermography

STMicroelectronics also developed a toy similar to mine, but with VL53L5: https://stm32ai.st.com/use-case/shifumi-gesture-recognition/

## [Step 2] Prototyping Acoustic Scene Detection

This is a project to develop edge AI for Acoustic Scene Detection based on Cube.AI, referring to my past project: https://github.com/araobp/acoustic-features

...

## Others

### [Arduino](Arduino)

Arduino is a device for testing sensor modules. Let Jupyter Notebook to collect data from sensors.

This is me.

### [CIFAR 10](CIFAR10)

The best accuracy I have ever achieved is 75%. Can I get a higher score than 75%?

### [MINIST](MNIST)

### [IMDb](IMDb)

### [Titanic](Titanic)

### [Audio](Audio)
