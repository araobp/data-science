# Acoustic Scene Classification

This is a project to develop edge AI for Acoustic Scene Classification based on STM32Cube.AI, referring to [my past project](https://github.com/araobp/acoustic-features).

Note: this project supports any PDM mic.

### Step 1: Designing Arduino shield of MEMS microphone

=> [Schematic](kicad/AcousticFeatureCamera)

### Step 2: Evaluation of MEMS microphone and DFSDM

=> [MEMSMIC](MEMSMIC.md)

### Step 3: Acoustic Feature Camera (without AI) 

=> [ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA](ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA.md)

### Step 4: Oscilloscope GUI

=> [Oscilloscope GUI (Tkinter)](python/OscilloscopeGUI)

### Step 5: Data Collection

### Step 6: Training CNN on Jupyter Notebook

### Step 7: Acoustic Feature Camera (with AI)

### Step 8: IoT

=> [BLE extension](python/BleExtension)

### Extra: 3DCG animation (Work in progress)

=> [Art of Acoustic Features](blender/ART.md)
