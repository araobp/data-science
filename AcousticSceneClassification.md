# Acoustic Scene Classification

This is a project to develop edge AI for Acoustic Scene Classification based on STM32Cube.AI, referring to my past project: https://github.com/araobp/acoustic-features

### Step 1: Designing Arduino shield of MEMS microphone

=> [Schematic](STM32/kicad/AcousticFeatureCamera)

### Step 2: Evaluation of MEMS microphone and DFSDM

=> [MEMSMIC](STM32/MEMSMIC.md)

### Step 3: Acoustic Feature Camera (without AI)

=> [ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA](STM32/ACOUSTIC_FEATURE_CAMERA.md) (Work in progress)

### Step 4: Data Collection

=> [Oscilloscope GUI](python/OscilloscopeGUI)

- Musical Instruments
- Key Words
- Life Log

### Step 5: Training CNN on Jupyter Notebook

### Step 6: Acoustic Feature Camera (with AI)
